## `ongoing_trips` View

This view shows detailed information about all trips currently marked as 'Ongoing'. It joins trips with driver, vehicle, and location data to display full trip context.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ongoing_trips AS
SELECT 
    t.TripID,
    d.DriverID,
    CONCAT(d.FirstName, ' ', d.LastName) AS DriverName,
    d.LicenseNumber AS DriverLicense,
    d.Phone AS DriverPhone,
    v.VehicleID,
    v.PlateNumber AS VehiclePlate,
    CONCAT(v.Make, ', ', v.Model) AS Vehicle,
    t.StartTime,
    t.EndTime,
    CONCAT(origin.Address, ', ', origin.City) AS OriginLocation,
    CONCAT(destination.Address, ', ', destination.City) As EndLocation,
    CONCAT(t.Distance, ' ', 'KM') AS Distance
FROM
    trip t
        JOIN driver d ON t.DriverID = d.DriverID
        JOIN vehicle v ON t.VehicleID = v.VehicleID
        JOIN location origin ON t.OriginLocationID = origin.LocationID
        JOIN location destination ON t.DestinationLocationID = destination.LocationID
WHERE
	t.TripStatus = 'Ongoing';
```

## `all_trips` View

This view provides a full history of all trips regardless of their status, combining trip data with related driver, vehicle, and location details.

```sql
CREATE VIEW all_trips AS
SELECT 
    t.TripID,
    CONCAT(d.FirstName, ' ', d.LastName) AS DriverName,
    d.DriverID,
    d.LicenseNumber AS DriverLicense,
    d.Phone AS DriverPhone,
    v.VehicleID,
    v.PlateNumber AS VehiclePlate,
    CONCAT(v.Make, ', ', v.Model) AS Vehicle,
    t.StartTime,
    t.EndTime,
    CONCAT(origin.Address, ', ', origin.City) AS OriginLocation,
    CONCAT(destination.Address, ', ', destination.City) As EndLocation,
    CONCAT(t.Distance, ' ', 'KM') AS Distance,
    t.TripStatus
FROM
    trip t
        JOIN driver d ON t.DriverID = d.DriverID
        JOIN vehicle v ON t.VehicleID = v.VehicleID
        JOIN location origin ON t.OriginLocationID = origin.LocationID
        JOIN location destination ON t.DestinationLocationID = destination.LocationID;
